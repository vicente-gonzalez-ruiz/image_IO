\section{Gray-scale images}
%{{{

Gray-Scale (GS) images have only one (usually
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance}{luminance}, expressed
proportionally by the gray colors) channel\footnote{They are usually
represented in color displays using gray tones (colors where the same
amount of red, green and blue components have been mixed). However, it
is quite difficult to find a color display with more than 256 gray
colors.}. In most of the cases, the number of bits per pixel (the so
called ``depth'' of the image) is $8$, but it is not rare to use up to
$16$ bits/pixel in specific contexts such as in
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging}{Medical Imaging}
and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing}{Remote
  Sensing}~\cite{burger2016digital}.
